# Module 02 Challenge: Advanced CSS Challenge: Professional Portfolio

Create a portfolio page from scratch! Employers will be looking at your portfolio, where you showcase your skills and talents.

This challenge will set you up for future success by applying core skills learned: flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables.
